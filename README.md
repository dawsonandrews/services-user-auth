## User auth service

Rack compatible user authentication microservice. Can be run standalone or mounted into another rack app.

#### Dependencies

Ensure you have Sequel (> v.4.44.0) setup and connected in your application before attempting to mount UserAuth.

- Sequel (model plugins: :timestamps, :validation_helpers, :defaults_setter)
- Postgres (pg gem)
- Rack 2.0

## Usage

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'user-auth', git: 'https://github.com/dawsonandrews/services-user-auth'
```

And then execute:

```sh
$ bundle
```

### Import and run migrations

```ruby
# Add this to your Rakefile
require "bundler/setup"
require "user_auth/rake_tasks"
```

Copy migrations and migrate:

```sh
$ bin/rake user_auth:import_migrations
$ bin/rake db:migrate
```

### Map to a URL in config.ru

```ruby
require_relative "./config/boot"
require "user_auth/api"

# Somewhere after your middleware

map("/auth") { run UserAuth::Api }
```

### Configuration

```ruby
# config/initializers/user_auth.rb
UserAuth.configure do |config|
  config.deliver_mail = lambda do |params|
    # example params =>
    # {
    #   template: "user_signup",
    #   to: "email@email.com",
    #   user_id: 123,
    #   info: {
    #     email: "email@email.com",
    #     name: "Jane"
    #   }
    # }
    EmailDeliveryJob.new(params)
  end
end
```

Thatâ€™s you all setup, see endpoints below for documentation on how to get a token etc.
